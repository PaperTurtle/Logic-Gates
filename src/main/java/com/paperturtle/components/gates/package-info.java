/**
 * This package contains the logic gate components for the Logic
 * Gate simulator
 * application.
 *
 * <p>
 * Logic gate components in this package represent the fundamental building
 * blocks of
 * digital circuits. These include various types of logic gates such as AND, OR,
 * NOT,
 * NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates. Each logic gate component simulates the
 * behavior of
 * its real-world counterpart, allowing users to create and analyze complex
 * digital circuits
 * by combining these gates.
