/**
 * This package contains input components for the Logic Gate

 *
 * <p>
 * Input components in this package represent the various elements that can
 * introduce
 * signals or values into the circuit simulations. These include components like
 * switch gates, which can toggle between on and off states, and constant gates
 * like
 * low/high constants, which provide fixed values. Input components allow users
 * to
 * manipulate and control the behavior of the simulated circuits.
