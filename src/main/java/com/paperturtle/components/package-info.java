/**
 * This package contains the components of the PaperTurtle Logic Gate simulator

 * 
 * <p>
 * Components in this package represent the various logic gates and other
 * elements
 * that can be used in the application's circuits. These include different types
 * of
 * logic gates like AND, OR, NOT, and more, as well as other components like
 * switches,
 * lightbulbs, and constant gates. Each component is designed to interact with
 * others
 * to simulate the behavior of a digital circuit.
